# Firebase Train Scheduler

## Overview

This is a train schedule application that uses Firebase to host arrival and departure data for trains. First, you schedule a train by entering relevant information about when it is first scheduled and how often it runs.  Then, the app shows the schedule of all the trains and when the next arrival time is and how many minutes until it arrives.
  
* When adding trains, you provide the following:
  * Train Name
  * Destination
  * First Train Time -- in military time
  * Frequency -- in minutes
  
* The app calculates when the next train will arrive based on current time and frequency

### To Do

* Get icon for portfolios and add to them
* clean up HTML and design
* Refactor code a bit
  
### Possible New Features

* Automatically update "minutes to arrival" and "next train time" once every minute.

* Add `update` and `remove` buttons for each train. Let the user edit the row's elements-- allow them to change a train's Name, Destination and Arrival Time (and then, by relation, minutes to arrival).

* As a final challenge, make it so that only users who log into the site with their Google or GitHub accounts can use your site. You'll need to read up on Firebase authentication for this bonus exercise.

## Linked my responsive portffolio and my bootstrap portfolio sites

I added a portfolio item to both my responsive and bootstrap portfolio.  Both of those have a portfolio item that links to this game.  Just click on the image to open up the game.  You can link to either of them by clicking the links below:

* [Responsvive Portfolio](https://plinck.github.io/Responsive-Portfolio/portfolio.html)
* [Bootstrap Portfolio](https://plinck.github.io/Bootstrap-Portfolio/portfolio.html)
